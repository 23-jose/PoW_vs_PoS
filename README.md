# Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake
## Abstract
Blockchain technologies, however recent, have become popularized
especially due to their use in the finance sector. Despite the benefits
blockchain technologies offer, there is a growing concern over their
enormous energy consumption and their impact on the climate
crisis, with research pointing to blockchain’s Proof of Work (PoW)
consensus mechanism as the main culprit of this issue. As such,
some blockchains have started to move away from PoW into other
mechanisms, with Proof of Stake (PoS) being pushed as a suitable
alternative to keep the integrity of blockchain’s while reducing
energy consumption. While research has showed that PoS does
indeed consume less energy, the is not a lot of research that focuses on directly comparing the two mechanisms in two different
blockchains. As such, this paper intended to address this problem by
directly comparing these two mechanisms across different metrics
(CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage and network traffic). For
this purpose, Bitcoin was selected as a blockchain that used PoW,
and Ethereum was chosen as a blockchain that moved away from
PoW into a PoS mechanism. Despite the small scale of this paper’s
experiments and the use of testnets rather than live blockchains, it
was still possible to observe that Ethereum’s PoS showed significant
reductions in CPU usage when compared to BItcoin’s PoW, with
other metrics not showing significant differences. This serves as
evidence that PoS does indeed consume less energy than PoW and
could be a more energy-efficient alternative.
